# Chest_X-Ray_Project
**This project diagnoses pneumonia from Chest X-Ray images using convolutional neural network and transfer learning via inception-V3. The images were of size greater than 1000 pixels per dimension and the total dataset was tagged large and had a space of 1.2 Gb. The project includes a neural network architecture for Binary Classification which was fine-tuned for efficient hyperparameters. Using ImageDataGenerator from TensorFlow I augmented the training image data to prevent overfitting along with the conventional regularisation methods such as Dropout, L1, and L2 Regularization and Early stopping. Other evaluatory metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1 score was also monitored. The accuracy of test data was 91.51% and the Micro Averaged F1 score was 0.933.**
