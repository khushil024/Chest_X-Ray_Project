# Chest_X-Ray_Project
**This project diagnoses pneumonia from Chest X-Ray images using convolutional neural network and tranfer learning via inception-V3. The images were of size greater than 1000 pixels per dimension and the total dataset was tagged large and had a space of 1.2 Gb . The project includes a neural network architecture for Binary Classification which was fine tuned for efficient hyperparameters and a variety of utility function of keras like callbacks for learning rate reduction and checkpointing were used. Using ImageDataGenerator from tensorflow we augmented the training image data to prevent overfitting along with the conventional regularisation methods such as Dropout, L1 and L2 Regularzations and Earlystopping. Other evaluatory metrics like Precision , Recall and F1 score were also monitored. The accuracy on test data was 91.51% and the F1 score was 0.933.**
