# Chest_X-Ray_Project
**This project diagnoses pneumonia from Chest X-Ray images using convolutional neural network and transfer learning via Inception-V3 Network. The images were of size greater than 1000 pixels per dimension and the total dataset was tagged large and had a space of 1.2 Gb. The project includes a neural network architecture for Binary Classification which was fine-tuned for efficient hyperparameters.Imgaug library was used to augment the training image data to solve the imbalance in the dataset.To prevent overfitting the conventional regularisation methods such as Dropout, L1, and L2 Regularization and Early stopping were used. Other evaluatory metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1 score were also monitored using Tensorflow's Metrics API. The accuracy on test data was 91.67% and the Micro Averaged F1 score was 0.934.
Confusion Matrix was also plotted for better visualization of the final results.
